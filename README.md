## My Process:

-Analyzed the provided design for layout, color scheme, typography, and imagery.
-Structured HTML with a container for centering and a card for content.
-Applied CSS for visual styling matching the design, including background colors, text formatting, and responsiveness of the QR code image.
-Used Flexbox in CSS to center the card on the page, both horizontally and vertically.
-Conducted browser testing to ensure the component renders correctly and made refinements for a precise match with the design.

### Built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned:

-Version Control with GitHub:
    introduced to the fundamentals of using GitHub for version control through trial and error, which included committing changes, pushing to repositories, and understanding the workflow of branches and merges.

-Responsive Design: 
    how to create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.

-Centering Content: 
    The use of Flexbox in CSS was demonstrated to center content both vertically and horizontally on the page.

-HTML5 Semantics: 
    The code used semantic HTML5 elements to structure the webpage, enhancing accessibility and readability.

-Styling: 
    CSS properties were applied to design elements to match a given visual design, including background colors, padding, and borders.

-Interactive Elements: 
    exerienced how an image (the QR code) can be integrated and made responsive within a web design.

### Continued development:

In my pursuit of professional growth, I aim to deepen my familiarity with GitHub, enhancing my grasp of version control through active participation in repositories and collaboration on open-source projects. Alongside this, I plan to refine my decision-making on when and where to use specific HTML elements, ensuring semantic appropriateness that boosts accessibility, SEO, and maintainability. My exploration will extend into various frameworks and plugins, including diving into frameworks like React or Angular, and experimenting with CSS preprocessors such as Sass or LESS. This exploration will be tailored to the requirements of individual projects, helping me balance the use of custom code with existing solutions to enhance functionality and efficiency.
